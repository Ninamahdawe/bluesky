Pick up keys along the way as they may help you pass through locked doors. Stay healthy by eating food and most importantly, be warned that you will encounter enemies and dangerous animals that will attempt to kill and prevent your passage. Complete your journey quickly and without being killed to be crowned king of the land. Good Luck!</p></p></h3>        <br>
